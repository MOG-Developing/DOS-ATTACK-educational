# _WARNING: EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY! YOU CAN GET INTO TROUBLE FOR THIS._

This project was made by me. Everything was made in python. It is easy to use.

- The port you should use is ``80``.

**Working on Windows-11/10** _haven't tested on linux and macos yet_

## REQUIREMENTS:
- Python 3.11 or Python 3.11.9
- Libraries: ``pip install tk customtkinter`` (the script uses these too: socket, threading, random, time)

MOG-DOS_V1 is powerful tho. ``In line_8`` you can type the amount of data you want(in bytes).
