# DOS-ATTACK-educational

# _WARNING: EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY! YOU CAN GET INTO TROUBLE FOR THIS._

## NOT A SIMULATION.

This project was made by me. Everything was made in python. It is easy to use.

_**Also this project is an actual DOS project so you should use it carefully and responsibly!**_

[How to Install and use MOG-DOS](https://github.com/MOG-Developing/DOS-ATTACK-educational/blob/main/HowToInstall.md)

- The port you should use is ``80``.
- Put the amount of threads you want(mostly the amount your CPU has)

**Working on Windows-11/10** _haven't tested on linux and macos yet_

## REQUIREMENTS:
- Python 3.11 or Python 3.11.9
- Libraries: ``pip install tk customtkinter`` (the script uses these too: socket, threading, random, time)
