# _WARNING: EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY! YOU CAN GET INTO TROUBLE FOR THIS._

## NOT A SIMULATION.

This project was made by me. Everything was made in python. It is easy to use.

_**Also this project is an actual DOS project so you should use it carefully and responsibly!**_

[How to Install and use MOG-DOS](https://github.com/MOG-Developing/DOS-ATTACK-educational/blob/main/HowToInstall.md)

- The port you should use is ``80``.
- Put the amount of threads you want(mostly the amount your CPU has)

**Working on Windows-11/10** _haven't tested on linux and macos yet_

## REQUIREMENTS:
- Python 3.11 or Python 3.11.9
- Libraries: ``pip install tk customtkinter`` (the script uses these too: socket, threading, random, time)

MOG-DOS_V4-UNSTABLE is a similar version to 1.1! Features such as: UDP Flood, TCP SYN Flood, HTTP Flood, HTTPS Flood, Slowloris attacks. Also it is kinda unstable and might have some bugs. Also it might lack some features. It uses alot of threads which might lead to some issues.
